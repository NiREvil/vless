# Temporarily disabled: automatic condig updates
# -------------------------------------------------
# Reason:
#   Cloudflare Warp endpoints are currently blocked in certain regions
#   (notably Iran and China), which causes connection failures when
#   automatic endpoint replacement runs inside this workflow.
#
# Action:
#   This workflow is intentionally commented out (disabled) to prevent
#   overwriting the manually working addresses.
#   I will manually insert the following IPs/domains in configurations
#   until the regional restrictions are lifted.
#
# Working addresses (manually configured):
#   • IPv4 range: 162.159.195.1 — 162.159.195.10
#   • IPv6 range: 2606:4700:d0::a29f:c001 — 2606:4700:d0::a29f:c014
#   • Custom domain: wire.nscl.ir
#
# Important:
#   ⚠️ Do NOT re-enable or edit this workflow to auto-replace endpoints
#   while these regional blocks remain active.
#
# Re-enable procedure:
#   1. Verify that Cloudflare/Warp endpoints are accessible again
#      from affected regions (Iran/China).
#   2. Uncomment this section to restore the workflow.
#   3. Test connectivity in staging before pushing to production.
#
# Disabled on: <add current date>
